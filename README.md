jaoss (pronounced jay-oss)
==========================

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/makeusabrew/jaoss.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/makeusabrew/jaoss)

JAOSS (which once upon a time I think stood for Just Another Open Source System)
is a lightweight, fast, object oriented, PHP5, MVC framework.

Another one?
------------

Yep. Mainly because I could never find one which quite fit *my* needs. Sorry about
that.

How do I use it?
---------------

Documentation is slowly but surely coming together on the [jaoss.org website](http://jaoss.org).
Your best bet for now is to check out the [tutorial](http://jaoss.org/docs/tutorial) and the 
various open source websites linked from there which use the jaoss framework.

Additionally, a [web template](https://github.com/makeusabrew/jaoss-web-template/) exists
which demonstrates use of the library in a very basic website.

Requirements
------------

PHP >= 5.3 (tiny adjustments would have to be made for 5.2 compatibility)
