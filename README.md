jaoss (pronounced jay-oss)
==========================

JAOSS (which once upon a time I think stood for Just Another Open Source System)
is a lightweight, fast, object oriented, PHP5, MVC framework.

Another one?
------------

Yep. Mainly because I could never find one which quite fit *my* needs. Sorry about
that.

How do I use it?
---------------

Documentation is slowly but surely coming together on the [jaoss.org website](http://jaoss.org).
Your best bet for now is to check out the [tutorial](http://jaoss.org/docs/tutorial) and the 
various open source websites linked from there which use the jaoss framework.

Requirements
------------

PHP >= 5.2
